# BACKBENCHER

## The purpose of this project is to run backtests on trading data to identify better historical trading strategies.

### Backtesting Mechanism 

We are going to use a simple backtesting strategy. We will analyse daily closing prices of stocks over a set period. If on a day, the return from the previous day is +ve, we will say we buy the stock. If not, we will sell the stock.
